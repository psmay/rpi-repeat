# A Position is data about one button/light. It is defined with these
# parameters:
# - soundName: The basename for the WAV file for the beep from this position
# - inPin: The GPIO number of the pin connected to the button for this position
# - outPin: The GPIO number of the pin connected to the LED for this position
# - sequenceLength: When button is pressed during attract mode, the number of
#   moves needed to win
